net-ambient = "present" everywhere there is internet access
pattern-slices = some kind of virtual object; can take days to build
perspective-set = would be cluttered by too many pattern-slices, unless they are "disperceive"d
BNI = bulk non-contact interface; the things in the helmet interface
PRI = proximate radio interface
Original helmet cable has massive plugs that "extend" the standard data cable plug, which is why a normal data cable *can* connect to helmet.

Access the data-cable by plugging in your helmet into the computer and hope that those things are connected.

Ah, crap. I hope we didn't break anything important.
Jz: decide it would be faster to just fly there yourself.
Anything left to do but just wait?
> Fast forward.
-P13:
> Reflect on said childhood, and how it relates to this "unusual style."
Tk: Locate your wayward apprentice before he does something stupid.
Then make sure your apprentice isn't doing anything foolish and impetuous.
((Also, how exactly does each symbol translate into each Latin character? 3 does not divide into 7 or 8 (the number of letters of each name, as far as I can see), and the 4 or 5 names that we have seen seem to be too much of a coïncidence that they manage to use ALL symbols that needs three letters to translate.. :befuddled: ))
>Medical facilities: Fail to properly repair Tk's brain.
>Wait for the other guy maybe?
Jz: See if Tk has repaired the systems that had been EMP'd. If not, he is therefore incapacitated, and you must carry on in his stead.
-P14
>Other guy: Status report
>Tk: Burst out of the surgery room before it is complete, wreak havoc on the city with your incomplete mind having both gone insane and developed hyper-powerful telekenetic abilities
Shewson: Explore the alien spaceship. Note how everything seems to be made for you.
Timmy: Feel oddly triangular.
Jz/Ship: Begin activating systems upon detecting "Shewson"'s genetic code.
Shewson, Timmy: Explore and experiment.
>Press all the buttons.
Jz: Consider degree to which the severed cable was necessary for your ship's proper operation. Then try to isolate the feral from the human.
-P15
Jz: Call out to whomever is there.
Jz: Mentally incapacitate the approaching entity.
Timmy: Burn the witch! Wait, you don't know where the witch is, and you shouldn't play with matches...
Jz: While absconding, assess the damage the subject and its human incurred on your ship.
Jz: Check up on Tkhlpzyv.
Unknown Adult: Realize that a) Timmy is unconscious, and b) the overgrown lizard seems to be trying to help by dragging Timmy out of the way of whatever they apparently encountered. And since it, whatever it is, seems to be dangerous, be on guard.
Jz: Be careful if adult human decides to be aggressive.
>Jz: Maybe you should simplify the situation by rendering the adult unconscious.
-P16
Adult Human: Figure out what's going on here.
> This is starting to get too complicated, prepare a Secondary Plan where the adult human's memories of you and the subject get erased, you wouldn't want the human to harm your subject with its dagger. But for plan A [...]
Jz: Consider that perhaps your subject has been kept -secret- from most of the humans excepting its companion. That would explain the reaction.
It isn't kosher to tell the characters directly about humans [i.e. "As a human, I know...", is it?
Timmy: Start crying.
Adult: Suddenly remember you had to go get some groceries in town; forget why you were in the woods in the first place, and leave.
Jz: Harming the humans is, at the moment, out of the question, especially when the subject trusts you enough to try to protect you, The logical options are a: let things go as they will here with the two humans, or b: follow the subject and conduct research ("research"   ) without the humans' accompaniment.
Shewson: Keep pulling, knives are more dangerous than that one time where Timmy scraped his knee on a rock, he started bleeding a bit and he cried, but it was only a small cut, you know knives will only make bigger cuts, and you don't want to see this girl dragon get hurt and bleed/cry.
Jz: Since the subject is a lot calmer, now might be the right time to probe its mind with your sensors, maybe in the process you can learn what it knows about the human language.
Shewson: teach the girl dragon how to climb trees and pretend to fly.
Timmy: remember what Mr. Jones told you about the war. Didn't it involve dragons?
Jz: Search memory for previous excursions into this particular world, including conflicts with the humans. This human is old and may well have memories of conflict.
>Cause a temporal paradox by throwing your knife at one of the dragon's faces.
-P17
Adult Human: Get the child back to the others, quickly- The people need to hear what has taken place.
Others: Uhoh! Mr. Jones forgot to take his medication again!
Mr.Jones: YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME, ITS TRUE!
Timmy: Run away now that Mr. Jones is distracted!
>If you can't find a better place to sleep, dig a hole in the side of a hill.
>Mr. Jones: Recount previous encounters with dragons with gusto to the archers. 
>Shewson: Try to teach the new friend GEROMY to talk. Maybe with body language if you don't know how to talk much yourself.*
Jay(modified): You need to learn how to talk to your new friend, see if it can teach you how
Jz(unmodified): Compare this mission to other missions idly, log mistakes and successes to improve future missions. Review what the point of this mission is.
Jz (unmodified) Identify the other creatures, please.
Jz: Identify creatures and their threat to the subject.
Small red thing: Hide behind big red thing.
Red things: Be all cute.
Red things: Have black feet, not red feet, like proper red things. Or perhaps the red feet are just a consequence of Shewson and Timmy's native art style.
-P18
J: *muffled* Your tongue! It's got your tongue! Stay extremely still and go prone.
Jz(unmodified): Damage assessment, take any recouperative action needed.
Jay: Claw it to make it let go, then get Shewson to back away slowly with you
>See if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with them.
Zap the big red quadriped with your metapsycic faculties.
Jz: Snuggle some more, you know you want to
Then contact your pal Tk and explain what is going on
Be sort of arrogant and rationalize a different plan of action anyway.
Quickly strike up conversation with everyone from the spaceport and see if they have input, if they can spare the proc-cycles to respond.
General query: What was the reason for the culling?
Shewson: MAKE CONFLICT
Tk: Consider supplying Jz with food and defense in some way, maybe indirectly if you can't travel right now for some reason.
>
TK: Support Jay indirectly by providing high-process-requirement data that Jay cannot spare cycles / time towards.
OR
TK: Document some more flaws in Jays work, and then find a good work-around for the aftermath.
Jay: Find a short-term food source within reach without disturbing the feral- Interrupting its rest cycle may cause issues.
Shewson: Try really hard to think, or even dream (!) about when you were first found.
Vc: Go over the summary data for your next feral.
Human Child: Try to explain yourself.
Adult Humans: Severely chastise human child, continue war preparations and fortification.
Jz: work together with Tk to find an ingenious way to amplify your REMI signals
Tk: also send support, just in case.
Shewson: dragon-purr and snuggle harder :P
Jay: Be embarrassed! (is the TALK still functioning right now?)
Tk: Elaborate further on the technology level of the human civilization on this planet.
Jz: Encode the necessary linguistic information into the TALK-VM. Set its current goal to keep the other dragon away from danger. Activate it.
Jay: Warn the other dragon not to go back!!!
Jz: This is more a question for the author, but what exactly do you mean by "experiment" with its state of mind? Is it just like a simple scan or can modifications be made? Can you communicate in this manner? If so, you should start trying to convince "Shewson" to return to civilization with you... forever. Maybe to entice it you could mention the ability to interact with many more of your species and the capability to expand his knowledge and capabilities far beyond their current levels.
-P19
Jz: Watch and learn.
Hm. If they are reasonable, then simply explaining to them that you intend to take this individual and leave may be the least dangerous course of action, but I'm not sure if they would respond well so...
Tk: Attempt to explain that you only mean to remove this fellow "dragon" from the environment, and mean them no harm.
Failing that, gauge their reaction to intimidation.
Tk: Assess what you can of the conversation, and the extent of their knowledge about your kind.
Shewson: This is really scary so run away.
Shewson: cry.
I am assuming the italic text is Tk influencing Shewson's mind. If this is correct (or if Tk would agree with the italic text in any case):
Tk: Render the subject unconscious and comply with their demands.
[[Call the ship back to pick them up as quickly as possible,]] while using telekinesis to place obstacles in the path of the arrows, prioritized according to the value of their target if it is not possible to intercept all of them. If there are no rocks or logs sufficiently large nearby, then [[use the less valuable person as the obstacle.]]
-P20
Shewson: Try your best to pronounce human words. Tell them Timmy is your best friend, and you were playing with a magic wand but you didn't mean to hurt him and then you met the new dragon and she helped you take Timmy to get help but everyone got mad and now you're scared.
Jz: Now that Tk is no longer controlling you, apply your own valuation to decide your course of action. If the probability that you will be killed in an escape attempt is too high, it may be less dangerous to have your ship get at least 1 km away, then focus on a large swath of land that includes the locations of the humans. You only need enough precision to crush the humans without harming yourself.
Next time you have an opportunity, try pulling out the damaged bar with your tail.
>Aha, progress! Eat the meat calmly, then go back to the corner until the human leaves.
>Maybe you can use it to pry the bars apart.
-P21
>Use leverage against the bars to tear it from his grip, or else break it in half.
> Steal that knife
>Compare durability of spear-weapon to durability of bars
> Wait until human(s) have left you unsupervised. Then chew through forelimb restraints to assist in remainder of escape attempt.
once you are no longer bound, examine the wobbly floor tile.

Your location currently has a posession request associated with it, which you accept.
Someone connects to you.
> 

Tk arrives about 1 hour after "maintaining" stabiliser will be ready.

threads:
Tk goes to medical place?
  they think Tk has impaired judgement
  or no 
Jz gets over-confident
Jz meets another group?
Jz drops from craft and flies around?  (no wings though...)
Jz meets locals?
  Causing them to hunt for Jz and find Shewson.
  Befirend/attack them to befriend Jz.
  Assumes that becuase Timmy likes SHewson then all humans here do
Humans keep secretes from one another.
Humans are longer-lived, and consider that things from decadces ago can still be relevant.

Jz possessed by Tk just at time of meeting / at some point?
Jz overdoes the "attraction" thing a bit
  Shewson will break down if seperated.

Need to re-state that Sh thinks self is female.  How?
  "Are all dragons girls?"
  or maybe from Mr Jones saying about "seduction" :-!

Sh will be socially retarded without REMS

Tk to be unavailable for hours after landing (panel 162)
  But all the walking in '205 eats up time
  Tk contact Jz while Jay is "asleep"?
Jay and Shewson grow to hate each other?
  that will bugger up the befriending part of the mission
  Nonono, the Value and Motivation system is seeded to like Shewson

But wait, humans shouldn't be arriving yet!
  scouting?
  second group?
  not humans?
  humans driven by something else?

Fabbing gifts.  Glass beads.
pull-into-hatch sploiters will look like cliche alien abduction
If one human looses arrow then attack it, because the other must pan aim traversely.
humans won't be satisfied with them running away.
shewson cries for timmy
  humans deny (amplify this to break hope)
  becomes braver?
    easier to fix than Jz
Jz injured (to increase Shewson binding?)
  arrow catch poss too
  if Jz lost/absconds, Sh is mentally unusable
Jz expensive, Sh cheap
  reveal lifespan
  reveal feral seeding
almost getting away, but then EMP from other thing.
