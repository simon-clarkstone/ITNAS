Did anyone spot that Su-4-7 is co-ordinates in nm, hence slightly over 8nm away?
- yes, amc(ish)

Linear Small-Body Accelerator
anyone spot ERR_AIPROG ?
anyone spot http://www.lonestarbowhunter.com/ ?

Sandals
apprentice (who we meet in Su-4-7)
net-ambient = "present" everywhere there is internet access
pattern-slices = some kind of virtual object; can take days to build
perspective-set = would be cluttered by too many pattern-slices, unless they are "disperceive"d
BNI = bulk non-contact interface; the things in the helmet interface
PRI = proximate radio interface
Original helmet cable has massive plugs that "extend" the standard data cable plug, which is why a normal data cable *can* connect to helmet.

none: radio
recognised, timmy has some: plastic, marble, shotgun cartridge

they are near "the Wall" (North)

Todo:
>Graph of computer progress (y) vs time (x): Have an asymptote at y=1
Voices: Fondly regard simulation
Fix it...
Swim around and look at the assorted pond wildlife.
>Eat one of those fish that are swimming around there.
Shooting star: defy expectations.
>Make sure not to hurt yourself on the pointy part.
- P7
> Interact with the light blue one I guess?
Dark blue, then ligt blue, then yellow, slowly increasing in complexity(?), then the supercomputer.
Investigate the stellar decahedron. Its pattern has already presented itself in the simulation.
>Go for the one that looks like a sun.
Use magnetic field lines to repel streams of charged particles from the star shaped object
>Okay, now try that light blue one in the top center
>Concentrate on the new feeling. Attempt to modify the construct responsible for it.
>See what happens if you move some of the icons into each other.
- P8
Try to either restart the interface or temporarily deactivate all perception activity. Heck, do both.
-P9
>Proceed to Su-4-7. If you feel like going over the basics of how that is accomplished, that would be nice too.
>While you're waiting, take inventory of your current capabilities.
-P10
> Bring them back to the computer room and see if things have changed with the computer now that you've seen them I guess?
-P11
...okay... now what?
Access the data-cable by plugging in your helmet into the computer and hope that those things are connected.
>I think the first order of business is to ascertain exactly where we are and how to get somewhere else.
-P12
>Start walking, or maybe flying, back to the spaceport.
Produce signal map for Michael Jackson's "Thriller"
>ahahahahah
Ascend.
Ah, crap. I hope we didn't break anything important.
Jz: decide it would be faster to just fly there yourself.
Anything left to do but just wait?
> Fast forward.
-P13:
> Reflect on said childhood, and how it relates to this "unusual style."
Tk: Locate your wayward apprentice before he does something stupid.
Then make sure your apprentice isn't doing anything foolish and impetuous.
((Also, how exactly does each symbol translate into each Latin character? 3 does not divide into 7 or 8 (the number of letters of each name, as far as I can see), and the 4 or 5 names that we have seen seem to be too much of a coïncidence that they manage to use ALL symbols that needs three letters to translate.. :befuddled: ))
>Medical facilities: Fail to properly repair Tk's brain.
>Wait for the other guy maybe?
Jz: See if Tk has repaired the systems that had been EMP'd. If not, he is therefore incapacitated, and you must carry on in his stead.
-P14
>Other guy: Status report
>Tk: Burst out of the surgery room before it is complete, wreak havoc on the city with your incomplete mind having both gone insane and developed hyper-powerful telekenetic abilities
Shewson: Explore the alien spaceship. Note how everything seems to be made for you.
Timmy: Feel oddly triangular.
Jz/Ship: Begin activating systems upon detecting "Shewson"'s genetic code.
Shewson, Timmy: Explore and experiment.
>Press all the buttons.
Jz: Consider degree to which the severed cable was necessary for your ship's proper operation. Then try to isolate the feral from the human.
-P15
Jz: Call out to whomever is there.
Jz: Mentally incapacitate the approaching entity.
Timmy: Burn the witch! Wait, you don't know where the witch is, and you shouldn't play with matches...
Jz: While absconding, assess the damage the subject and its human incurred on your ship.
Jz: Check up on Tkhlpzyv.
Unknown Adult: Realize that a) Timmy is unconscious, and b) the overgrown lizard seems to be trying to help by dragging Timmy out of the way of whatever they apparently encountered. And since it, whatever it is, seems to be dangerous, be on guard.
Jz: Be careful if adult human decides to be aggressive.
>Jz: Maybe you should simplify the situation by rendering the adult unconscious.
-P16
Adult Human: Figure out what's going on here.
> This is starting to get too complicated, prepare a Secondary Plan where the adult human's memories of you and the subject get erased, you wouldn't want the human to harm your subject with its dagger. But for plan A [...]
Jz: Consider that perhaps your subject has been kept -secret- from most of the humans excepting its companion. That would explain the reaction.
It isn't kosher to tell the characters directly about humans [i.e. "As a human, I know...", is it?
Timmy: Start crying.
Adult: Suddenly remember you had to go get some groceries in town; forget why you were in the woods in the first place, and leave.
Jz: Harming the humans is, at the moment, out of the question, especially when the subject trusts you enough to try to protect you, The logical options are a: let things go as they will here with the two humans, or b: follow the subject and conduct research ("research"   ) without the humans' accompaniment.
Shewson: Keep pulling, knives are more dangerous than that one time where Timmy scraped his knee on a rock, he started bleeding a bit and he cried, but it was only a small cut, you know knives will only make bigger cuts, and you don't want to see this girl dragon get hurt and bleed/cry.
Jz: Since the subject is a lot calmer, now might be the right time to probe its mind with your sensors, maybe in the process you can learn what it knows about the human language.
Shewson: teach the girl dragon how to climb trees and pretend to fly.
Timmy: remember what Mr. Jones told you about the war. Didn't it involve dragons?
Jz: Search memory for previous excursions into this particular world, including conflicts with the humans. This human is old and may well have memories of conflict.
>Cause a temporal paradox by throwing your knife at one of the dragon's faces.
-P17
Adult Human: Get the child back to the others, quickly- The people need to hear what has taken place.
Others: Uhoh! Mr. Jones forgot to take his medication again!
Mr.Jones: YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME, ITS TRUE!
Timmy: Run away now that Mr. Jones is distracted!
>sleep snuggled up all cutely 
>If you can't find a better place to sleep, dig a hole in the side of a hill.
>Mr. Jones: Recount previous encounters with dragons with gusto to the archers. 
>Shewson: Try to teach the new friend GEROMY to talk. Maybe with body language if you don't know how to talk much yourself.*
Jay(modified): You need to learn how to talk to your new friend, see if it can teach you how
Jz(unmodified): Compare this mission to other missions idly, log mistakes and successes to improve future missions. Review what the point of this mission is.
Jz (unmodified) Identify the other creatures, please.
Jz: Identify creatures and their threat to the subject.
Small red thing: Hide behind big red thing.
Red things: Be all cute.
Red things: Have black feet, not red feet, like proper red things. Or perhaps the red feet are just a consequence of Shewson and Timmy's native art style.
-P18
J: *muffled* Your tongue! It's got your tongue! Stay extremely still and go prone.
S: Leap to the defense of J, fear be damned!
Jz(unmodified): Damage assessment, take any recouperative action needed.
Jay: Claw it to make it let go, then get Shewson to back away slowly with you
>See if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with them.
Zap the big red quadriped with your metapsycic faculties.

Your location currently has a posession request associated with it, which you accept.
Someone connects to you.
> 

Tk arrives about 1 hour after "maintaining" stabiliser will be ready.

threads:
Tk goes to medical place?
  they think Tk has impaired judgement
  or no 
Jz gets over-confident
Jz meets another group?
Jz drops from craft and flies around?  (no wings though...)
Jz meets locals?
  Causing them to hunt for Jz and find Shewson.
  Befirend/attack them to befriend Jz.
  Assumes that becuase Timmy likes SHewson then all humans here do
Humans keep secretes from one another.
Humans are longer-lived, and consider that things from decadces ago can still be relevant.

Jz possessed by Tk just at time of meeting / at some point?
Jz overdoes the "attraction" thing a bit

Need to re-state that Sh thinks self is female.  How?
  "Are all dragons girls?"
  or maybe from Mr Jones saying about "seduction" :-!

Sh will be socially retarded without REMS

Tk to be unavailable for hours after landing (panel 162)
  But all the walking in '205 eats up time
  Tk contact Jz while Jay is "asleep"?
Jay and Shewson grow to hate each other?
  that will bugger up the befriending part of the mission
  Nonono, the Value and Motivation system is seeded to like Shewson
