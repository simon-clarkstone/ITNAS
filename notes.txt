Did anyone spot that Su-4-7 is co-ordinates in nm, hence slightly over 8nm away?

Linear Small-Body Accelerator
anyone spot ERR_AIPROG ?
anyone spot http://www.lonestarbowhunter.com/ ?

Sandals
apprentice (who we meet in Su-4-7)
net-ambient = "present" everywhere there is internet access
pattern-slices = some kind of virtual object; can take days to build
perspective-set = would be cluttered by too many pattern-slices, unless they are "disperceive"d
BNI = bulk non-contact interface; the things in the helmet interface
PRI = proximate radio interface
Original helmet cable has massive plugs that "extend" the standard data cable plug, which is why a normal data cable *can* connect to helmet.

Jz will proceed without Tk:

Todo:
>Graph of computer progress (y) vs time (x): Have an asymptote at y=1
Voices: Fondly regard simulation
Fix it...
Swim around and look at the assorted pond wildlife.
>Eat one of those fish that are swimming around there.
Shooting star: defy expectations.
>Make sure not to hurt yourself on the pointy part.
- P7
> Interact with the light blue one I guess?
Dark blue, then ligt blue, then yellow, slowly increasing in complexity(?), then the supercomputer.
Investigate the stellar decahedron. Its pattern has already presented itself in the simulation.
>Go for the one that looks like a sun.
Use magnetic field lines to repel streams of charged particles from the star shaped object
>Okay, now try that light blue one in the top center
>Concentrate on the new feeling. Attempt to modify the construct responsible for it.
>See what happens if you move some of the icons into each other.
- P8
Try to either restart the interface or temporarily deactivate all perception activity. Heck, do both.
-P9
>Proceed to Su-4-7. If you feel like going over the basics of how that is accomplished, that would be nice too.
>While you're waiting, take inventory of your current capabilities.
-P10
> Bring them back to the computer room and see if things have changed with the computer now that you've seen them I guess?
-P11
...okay... now what?
Access the data-cable by plugging in your helmet into the computer and hope that those things are connected.
>I think the first order of business is to ascertain exactly where we are and how to get somewhere else.
-P12
>Start walking, or maybe flying, back to the spaceport.
Produce signal map for Michael Jackson's "Thriller"
>ahahahahah
Ascend.
Ah, crap. I hope we didn't break anything important.
Jz: decide it would be faster to just fly there yourself.
Anything left to do but just wait?
> Fast forward.
-P13:
> Reflect on said childhood, and how it relates to this "unusual style."
Tk: Locate your wayward apprentice before he does something stupid.
Then make sure your apprentice isn't doing anything foolish and impetuous.
((Also, how exactly does each symbol translate into each Latin character? 3 does not divide into 7 or 8 (the number of letters of each name, as far as I can see), and the 4 or 5 names that we have seen seem to be too much of a coïncidence that they manage to use ALL symbols that needs three letters to translate.. :befuddled: ))
>Medical facilities: Fail to properly repair Tk's brain.
>Wait for the other guy maybe?
Jz: See if Tk has repaired the systems that had been EMP'd. If not, he is therefore incapacitated, and you must carry on in his stead.
-P14
>Other guy: Status report
>Tk: Burst out of the surgery room before it is complete, wreak havoc on the city with your incomplete mind having both gone insane and developed hyper-powerful telekenetic abilities
Shewson: Explore the alien spaceship. Note how everything seems to be made for you.
Timmy: Feel oddly triangular.
Jz/Ship: Begin activating systems upon detecting "Shewson"'s genetic code.
Shewson, Timmy: Explore and experiment.
>Press all the buttons.
Jz: Consider degree to which the severed cable was necessary for your ship's proper operation. Then try to isolate the feral from the human.
Jz: Call out to whomever is there.
Jz: Mentally incapacitate the approaching entity.
Timmy: Burn the witch! Wait, you don't know where the witch is, and you shouldn't play with matches...
Wreck the witch's stuff! Or take its magic for your own! You're a wizard, Timmy!
Jz: While absconding, assess the damage the subject and its human incurred on your ship.
