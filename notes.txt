Did anyone spot that Su-4-7 is co-ordinates in nm, hence slightly over 8nm away?
- yes, amc(ish)

Linear Small-Body Accelerator
anyone spot ERR_AIPROG ?

apprentice (who we meet in Su-4-7)
net-ambient = "present" everywhere there is internet access
pattern-slices = some kind of virtual object; can take days to build
perspective-set = would be cluttered by too many pattern-slices, unless they are "disperceive"d
BNI = bulk non-contact interface; the things in the helmet interface
PRI = proximate radio interface
Original helmet cable has massive plugs that "extend" the standard data cable plug, which is why a normal data cable *can* connect to helmet.

Try to either restart the interface or temporarily deactivate all perception activity. Heck, do both.

Access the data-cable by plugging in your helmet into the computer and hope that those things are connected.

Ah, crap. I hope we didn't break anything important.
Jz: decide it would be faster to just fly there yourself.
Anything left to do but just wait?
> Fast forward.
-P13:
> Reflect on said childhood, and how it relates to this "unusual style."
Tk: Locate your wayward apprentice before he does something stupid.
Then make sure your apprentice isn't doing anything foolish and impetuous.
((Also, how exactly does each symbol translate into each Latin character? 3 does not divide into 7 or 8 (the number of letters of each name, as far as I can see), and the 4 or 5 names that we have seen seem to be too much of a coïncidence that they manage to use ALL symbols that needs three letters to translate.. :befuddled: ))
>Medical facilities: Fail to properly repair Tk's brain.
>Wait for the other guy maybe?
Jz: See if Tk has repaired the systems that had been EMP'd. If not, he is therefore incapacitated, and you must carry on in his stead.
-P14
>Other guy: Status report
>Tk: Burst out of the surgery room before it is complete, wreak havoc on the city with your incomplete mind having both gone insane and developed hyper-powerful telekenetic abilities
Shewson: Explore the alien spaceship. Note how everything seems to be made for you.
Timmy: Feel oddly triangular.
Jz/Ship: Begin activating systems upon detecting "Shewson"'s genetic code.
Shewson, Timmy: Explore and experiment.
>Press all the buttons.
Jz: Consider degree to which the severed cable was necessary for your ship's proper operation. Then try to isolate the feral from the human.
-P15
Jz: Call out to whomever is there.
Jz: Mentally incapacitate the approaching entity.
Timmy: Burn the witch! Wait, you don't know where the witch is, and you shouldn't play with matches...
Jz: While absconding, assess the damage the subject and its human incurred on your ship.
Jz: Check up on Tkhlpzyv.
Unknown Adult: Realize that a) Timmy is unconscious, and b) the overgrown lizard seems to be trying to help by dragging Timmy out of the way of whatever they apparently encountered. And since it, whatever it is, seems to be dangerous, be on guard.
Jz: Be careful if adult human decides to be aggressive.
>Jz: Maybe you should simplify the situation by rendering the adult unconscious.
-P16
Adult Human: Figure out what's going on here.
> This is starting to get too complicated, prepare a Secondary Plan where the adult human's memories of you and the subject get erased, you wouldn't want the human to harm your subject with its dagger. But for plan A [...]
Jz: Consider that perhaps your subject has been kept -secret- from most of the humans excepting its companion. That would explain the reaction.
It isn't kosher to tell the characters directly about humans [i.e. "As a human, I know...", is it?
Timmy: Start crying.
Adult: Suddenly remember you had to go get some groceries in town; forget why you were in the woods in the first place, and leave.
Jz: Harming the humans is, at the moment, out of the question, especially when the subject trusts you enough to try to protect you, The logical options are a: let things go as they will here with the two humans, or b: follow the subject and conduct research ("research"   ) without the humans' accompaniment.
Shewson: Keep pulling, knives are more dangerous than that one time where Timmy scraped his knee on a rock, he started bleeding a bit and he cried, but it was only a small cut, you know knives will only make bigger cuts, and you don't want to see this girl dragon get hurt and bleed/cry.
Jz: Since the subject is a lot calmer, now might be the right time to probe its mind with your sensors, maybe in the process you can learn what it knows about the human language.
Shewson: teach the girl dragon how to climb trees and pretend to fly.
Timmy: remember what Mr. Jones told you about the war. Didn't it involve dragons?
Jz: Search memory for previous excursions into this particular world, including conflicts with the humans. This human is old and may well have memories of conflict.
>Cause a temporal paradox by throwing your knife at one of the dragon's faces.
-P17
Adult Human: Get the child back to the others, quickly- The people need to hear what has taken place.
Others: Uhoh! Mr. Jones forgot to take his medication again!
Mr.Jones: YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME, ITS TRUE!
Timmy: Run away now that Mr. Jones is distracted!
>If you can't find a better place to sleep, dig a hole in the side of a hill.
>Mr. Jones: Recount previous encounters with dragons with gusto to the archers. 
>Shewson: Try to teach the new friend GEROMY to talk. Maybe with body language if you don't know how to talk much yourself.*
Jay(modified): You need to learn how to talk to your new friend, see if it can teach you how
Jz(unmodified): Compare this mission to other missions idly, log mistakes and successes to improve future missions. Review what the point of this mission is.
Jz (unmodified) Identify the other creatures, please.
Jz: Identify creatures and their threat to the subject.
Small red thing: Hide behind big red thing.
Red things: Be all cute.
Red things: Have black feet, not red feet, like proper red things. Or perhaps the red feet are just a consequence of Shewson and Timmy's native art style.
-P18
J: *muffled* Your tongue! It's got your tongue! Stay extremely still and go prone.
Jz(unmodified): Damage assessment, take any recouperative action needed.
Jay: Claw it to make it let go, then get Shewson to back away slowly with you
>See if you can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with them.
Zap the big red quadriped with your metapsycic faculties.

damn right don't trust it, because the cooling system is buggered:

Your location currently has a posession request associated with it, which you accept.
Someone connects to you.
> 

Tk arrives about 1 hour after "maintaining" stabiliser will be ready.

threads:
Tk goes to medical place?
  they think Tk has impaired judgement
  or no 
Jz gets over-confident
Jz meets another group?
Jz drops from craft and flies around?  (no wings though...)
Jz meets locals?
  Causing them to hunt for Jz and find Shewson.
  Befirend/attack them to befriend Jz.
  Assumes that becuase Timmy likes SHewson then all humans here do
Humans keep secretes from one another.
Humans are longer-lived, and consider that things from decadces ago can still be relevant.

Jz possessed by Tk just at time of meeting / at some point?
Jz overdoes the "attraction" thing a bit
  Shewson will break down if seperated.

Need to re-state that Sh thinks self is female.  How?
  "Are all dragons girls?"
  or maybe from Mr Jones saying about "seduction" :-!

Sh will be socially retarded without REMS

Tk to be unavailable for hours after landing (panel 162)
  But all the walking in '205 eats up time
  Tk contact Jz while Jay is "asleep"?
Jay and Shewson grow to hate each other?
  that will bugger up the befriending part of the mission
  Nonono, the Value and Motivation system is seeded to like Shewson

[i]Warning: diagram requires 3 dimensions for rendering.  The following two-dimensional rendering is an approximation; information loss may occur.[/i]




As you expected, Tkhlpzyv began monitoring your activities soon after waking up, and sent a message for you to contact Tk and Vcypcsua as soon as you were able to.  You are also eager to contact them.  (The resulting conversation includes some side-branches that proceed in parallel with the main path.)
[quote]Jz: I can talk now.
Jz: I was in an altered state to help with the retrieval of Ln-4-7-22.
Jz: I created a new VMS which is capable of the type of friendship that it is accustomed to.
Jzaprvlt sends a specification.
Tk: The fact that you can do this without needing days of preparation really makes me feel out-of-date.
Vc: But you will need to perform trust generalisation on the subject to help with the post-retrieval work.
[quote]Vc: That task will be made more difficult because your initial brain-signal manipulation of the subject was excessive.
Vcypcsua sends a pattern-analysis.
Vc: It will cause trouble with separating you from the subject when it must be passed on to me.
Jz: It desires my presence, but trust generalisation can let you substitute for me gradually.
Vc: But the degree to which it responds to you is much more than the normal levels desired.
Vc: Separation without inducing an uncooperative and resistant state will be a much slower process than normal.
Vc: Your physical presence and involvement will be required for weeks.
Jz: I will be able to assist your with your work, and learn about it, so my time will not be completely wasted.
Tk: But that leaves me with no assistance.[/quote]
Vc: Once you can speak its language that will help.
Tk: I have been working on that, using ps82.
Tkhlpzyv sends some language data.
[quote]Jz: You didn't use my enhancements from #d11748 - #d11750?
Tk: No.  I already explained to you why having an LFI-mesh rather than a grid is over-generalisation.
Vc: I don't know if it's a bad idea as such, but it does need more documentation.
Tk: I can confirm that it really is a bad idea.[/quote]
Tk: I found that the humans now speak a merged version of two of the languages they had during our culling of them.
Jz: Does the translation solve the question of the inconsistent reactions to me and the subject from the different humans?
Tk: Almost all of this group of humans fear us, because of their memories of the culling.
[quote]Tk: But I already knew what was going on before translating.
Jz: Well why wasn't the young one afraid?
Tk: The young human encountered the subject when the subject was small enough that the human did not perceive it as a threat.
Vc: And young enough that the human succeeded in imposing human structures on its mind and befriending it.
Jz: If that's all, why didn't the situation equalise?
Tk: Because they are humans, not people.
Tk: You are thinking of their communication as being like ours, but it isn't.
Tk: The young human desired to keep its friend, and knew that the others would forbid this if they discovered, so it concealed the fact from them.
Jz: It was trying to gather evidence that LN-4-7-22 was harmless?
Jz: Wouldn't it have enough before now?
Tk: No.  It was misleading them to help its own goals not any collective ones.
Jz: Aha.  And that worked because... the other humans didn't know what it was doing most of the time!
Jz: I have learnt about deception and purely-personal goals and low-communication groups.
Jz: But when you put it all together it really becomes something new.
Vc: I only usually encounter ferals doing those things, in a 1-sided way.
Vc: I might not have spotted what was going on either.
Tk: This is an unusually complicated situation; one needs to have years of practice with humans to realise what is going on.
Tk: And having to understand humans that well is why you needed to wait for me rather than acting alone.
Jz: I am newer than you; my ability to improvise is well beyond what you were capable of at my age, or now.
Tk: True, but that still doesn't compensate for your lack of experience and planning.
Tk: With planning you would have been able to meet the subject and its human in a location where you wouldn't have been discovered.[/quote]
Jz: This means becoming known to the humans could cause future problems if they become more vigilant as a consequence.
Jz: They do not seem to enter the area that we are in, north of the long wall.
Jz: Even though the radiation here is not far above the background level.
Jz: The attack that hit it did not create such long-lived isotopes.
Tk: These humans must think the half-life to be longer than it actually is.
Tk: But they may desire enough to kill you both to enter the area.
Tk: Their longbows are a threat to you if they stay beyond your REMI range.
Tk: And longbows will emit the loaded projectile if you attack the wielder incorrectly.
Jzaprvlt sends a sketch.
Tk: Yes, that is about the best you can do when they are more than a couple of metres away.
Jz: What should my strategy be?
Vc: Your method of rapidly making the subject desire your presence partly compensates for the human threat you have created.
Vc: It will expedite getting the subject to abandon its human companion, if it wishes to follow you.
Tk: You must ensure the subject realises that the humans will physically restrain the youth if necessary to prevent it from meeting the subject.
Jz: I cannot evacuate immediately then?
Vc: No.  LN-4-7-22's expectation of reuniting with its human must reduce before it will leave.
Jz: I will be sure to stay close to it.
Vc: I must now fully attend to my work on other ferals.[/quote]
Vcypcsua ceases conversing with you, but Tkhlpzyv remains partially attentive.
