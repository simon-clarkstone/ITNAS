Did anyone spot that Su-4-7 is co-ordinates in nm, hence slightly over 8nm away?
- yes, amc(ish)

Linear Small-Body Accelerator
anyone spot ERR_AIPROG ?
anyone spot http://www.lonestarbowhunter.com/ ?

apprentice (who we meet in Su-4-7)
net-ambient = "present" everywhere there is internet access
pattern-slices = some kind of virtual object; can take days to build
perspective-set = would be cluttered by too many pattern-slices, unless they are "disperceive"d
BNI = bulk non-contact interface; the things in the helmet interface
PRI = proximate radio interface
Original helmet cable has massive plugs that "extend" the standard data cable plug, which is why a normal data cable *can* connect to helmet.

>Graph of computer progress (y) vs time (x): Have an asymptote at y=1
Voices: Fondly regard simulation
Fix it...
Swim around and look at the assorted pond wildlife.
>Eat one of those fish that are swimming around there.
Shooting star: defy expectations.
>Make sure not to hurt yourself on the pointy part.
- P7
> Interact with the light blue one I guess?
Dark blue, then ligt blue, then yellow, slowly increasing in complexity(?), then the supercomputer.
Investigate the stellar decahedron. Its pattern has already presented itself in the simulation.
>Go for the one that looks like a sun.
Use magnetic field lines to repel streams of charged particles from the star shaped object
>Okay, now try that light blue one in the top center
>Concentrate on the new feeling. Attempt to modify the construct responsible for it.
>See what happens if you move some of the icons into each other.
- P8
Try to either restart the interface or temporarily deactivate all perception activity. Heck, do both.
-P9
>Proceed to Su-4-7. If you feel like going over the basics of how that is accomplished, that would be nice too.
>While you're waiting, take inventory of your current capabilities.
-P10
> Bring them back to the computer room and see if things have changed with the computer now that you've seen them I guess?
-P11
...okay... now what?
Access the data-cable by plugging in your helmet into the computer and hope that those things are connected.

You check the status of the stabilisers over in Su-0-0.
The backup one that suddenly went offline came back online after only a few minutes,
but it cannot be trusted now until the cause of its failure can be ascertained.
An armed team is also going to the one the

The team that performing routine maintainance on one of the stabilisers are postponing their work and are putting it immediately back into working order.
They should have it ready in half an hour or so, whereupon upward-bound traffic can resume.

You remove yourself from the list of potentially-missing persons;
As you expected, no-one has known where you were since you lost consciousness that first time.

You also begin assembling the records of what has happened to you since you set off for the spaceport.



Your location currently has a posession request associated with it, which you accept.
Someone connects to you.
> 

You acquire some updates for your map to find out what this place is.

You check to see where Jzaprvlt is.  Jz is at the spaceport in Su-x8-5 and planning to ascend, despite you having gone missing.

Tk: Hello.
Jz: What happened to you?  I removed you from the prerequisites for my journey.
(this conversation has forked)


Tk check's Jz's location.
Tk: Where are you going?
Jz: To Su-4-7.
Tk: What are you going to do there without me?
Jz: I'll examine subject LN-4-7-22.
Tk: That is not what we originally planned.
Jz: I had to change the plans when you disappeared.
Tk: Why not just wait for me on the other side?
Jz: I don't want to waste time.  Instead of waiting for you I can begin examining the situation closer.
Tk: But you will be doing it alone.
Jz: I can manage that.
Tk: You won't be able to get much done on your own.  Not if you're doing it properly
Jz: I don't need 



Tk: I'm not sure.  I probably got EMPed by something.
Jz: You don't know any more than that?
Tk: Not much.  I am writing it up currently.
Jz examines what Tk has written already.
Jz: You didn't see anything that could have caused it?
Tk: Not that I recall.
Jz: And there was no warning before it happened?
Tk: Wait until I finish the write-up.  These questions will all be answered there.
Jz sends Tk information about Tk's location.
Tk: I was about to look that up
Jz:
