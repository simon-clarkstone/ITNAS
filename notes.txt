Did anyone spot that Su-4-7 is co-ordinates in nm, hence slightly over 8nm away?
- yes, amc(ish)

Linear Small-Body Accelerator
anyone spot ERR_AIPROG ?

Todo:
>Graph of computer progress (y) vs time (x): Have an asymptote at y=1
Voices: Fondly regard simulation
Fix it...
Swim around and look at the assorted pond wildlife.
>Eat one of those fish that are swimming around there.
Shooting star: defy expectations.
>Make sure not to hurt yourself on the pointy part.

> Interact with the light blue one I guess?
Dark blue, then ligt blue, then yellow, slowly increasing in complexity(?), then the supercomputer.
Investigate the stellar decahedron. Its pattern has already presented itself in the simulation.
>Go for the one that looks like a sun.
Use magnetic field lines to repel streams of charged particles from the star shaped object
>Okay, now try that light blue one in the top center
>Concentrate on the new feeling. Attempt to modify the construct responsible for it.
>See what happens if you move some of the icons into each other.
